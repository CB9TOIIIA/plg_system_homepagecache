PLG_SYSTEM_HOMEPAGECACHE_XML_DESCRIPTION="Provides homepage caching and caching for 3 priority levels of pages you specify (the 3 levels allow you to turn caching on/off for those pages easily throughout the year depending on when it is needed). After installing, please ensure that this plugin is the last SYSTEM Plugin when ordered (this helps prevent rendering issues because the System SEF Plugin needs to run first)."
